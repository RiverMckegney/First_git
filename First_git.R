# Verify Connection:
usethis::git_sitrep()

# First, lets explain the code above: package::function()

# Note: 'usethis' is the package, while :: (double colon) is extracting specific function [git_sitrep()] from that package. 
# So instead of library(usethis), this method accesses package and uses it for the specific function without needing to load the entire package.
# Note: This might be important later on, when packages have conflicting function styles (and recognizing the order packages are loaded matters).
