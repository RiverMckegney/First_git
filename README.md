# First_git
Try Github for the first time. Introductory practice with git and link (hooking up) with Rstudio. Note this info is stored in the read.me file.  Lets git into it!

Now I am accessing and entering this info in Rstudio! To save and send these changes from Rstudio to git I will move over to the environment pane and go to the Git tab, then check (click check box) all the items/files there and press Commit. 

Remember to save your file in Rstudio before sending the commit (so Github obtains the most recent version).

The remote directory (Github) should presently look like the local repository (Rstudio).

After sending the first commit, now the changes I make will be pushes, and for now on I will press the 'push' button in the commit pop-up window to send these new changes made.
Note that pressing the green push arrow in Rstudio does not actively send a push to GitHub, and also recognize that when doing so I did not enter a commit message (detailing the changes made).
I will come back to how to go about working the green push arrow and blue pull arrow icons.

The 'pull' option or pulling changes is when you want to download/extract or bring down file changes that collaborators made (currently stored in github) and add thoes updates to your local repository in Rstudio.
