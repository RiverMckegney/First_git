# First_git
Try Github for the first time. Introductory practice with git and link (hooking up) with Rstudio. Note this info is stored in the read.me file.  Lets git into it!

Now I am accessing and entering this info in Rstudio! To save and send these changes from Rstudio to git I will move over to the environment pane and go to the Git tab, then check (click check box) all the items/files there and press Commit. 

Remember to save your file in Rstudio before sending the commit (so Github obtains the most recent version).
